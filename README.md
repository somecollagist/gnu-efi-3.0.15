# GNU EFI 3.0.15

This is a copy of the source code of GNU-EFI version 3.0.15. I created this so I have a permalink to this version to compile my custom operating system, [Derecho](https://github.com/somecollagist/Derecho). You can find a link to where I cloned this from [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnu-efi/code/ci/3.0.15/tree/).

You can find a license for this source code in the file `README.efilib`.
